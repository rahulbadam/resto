Our <strong>backstage <\/strong><strong>catering team<\/strong> were delighted to feed such a pleasant bunch!<\/p>\n<p>Spirits were high throughout despite a downpour or two, but away from the sombre great British weather, it was great to see lots of glowing faces chatting away over our freshly prepared, home-cooked delights.<\/p>\n<p>We hooked our guests up with a feast designed to hype up the taste buds and satisfy the soul. A few popular favourites were our creamy gnocchi, flavoursome Jamaican jerk chicken and tasty buffalo cauliflower wings. Our Sunday dinner spread was the most talked about and not forgetting a long-standing classic &#8211;\u00a0 our delicious vegan brownie.<\/p>\n<p>The riders, as always, were given the Radish treatment. Everything was carefully prepared and delivered with a smile, with no request too big or too small for us to handle.<\/p>\n<p>It was great to see lots of happy guests and we hope to be back next year!<\/p>\n<p>If you are looking for someone to serve up fantastic fodder for your backstage artists we&#8217;d loved to help you. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.red-radish.com\/contact-us\/\"><strong>Get in touch&#8230;<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To kick off the festival season we spent an enjoyable weekend providing artist and crew catering at Neighbourhood Weekender in Warrington.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13875,"featured_media":9058,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[27,11],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-9043","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-festivals","category-latest-blog-postings"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.5 -
