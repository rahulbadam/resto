Festival season looms and Red Radish hit 3-4 solid months of touring the country feeding crew, artists and punters at multiple events per week.<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, this spring and summer have ended up decidedly different. The outbreak of COVID-19 was bound to hit our industry hard and, as expected, festivals dropped like flies from our calendar.<\/p>\n<h2>Helping feed the homeless during the coronavirus outbreak<\/h2>\n<p>Back in March, we were contacted about a project in the pipeline that would see thousands of London\u2019s homeless housed in hotels across the city, left empty by the lockdown.<\/p>\n<p>It might now seem obvious that this virus could have a catastrophic impact on those most vulnerable in society, but back when this still felt like an abstract concept, the scale and speed of the effort to protect the homeless in particular was extraordinary.<\/p>\n<p>In this case it was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mungos.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">St Mungo\u2019s<\/a>, one of the UK\u2019s leading homelessness charities, and the Mayor of London that took the initiative. In the space of a few weeks,<strong> over 5,000 homeless people across England and Wales were housed in hotels<\/strong> in an incredible emergency operation to get all rough sleepers off the streets amidst this outbreak. Many of them are in hotels are in London and being managed and operated by St Mungo\u2019s and the Mayor of London.<\/p>\n<p>Part of this enormous undertaking required three meals a day to be delivered to each resident in the hotels for the indefinite lockdown period. That translates to a <strong>gargantuan catering job<\/strong>, but after a bit of deliberation we knew we could crack it.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9506 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.red-radish.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/radish-operation-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"red-radish-coronavirus-help\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.red-radish.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/radish-operation-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.red-radish.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/radish-operation-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.red-radish.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/radish-operation-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.red-radish.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/radish-operation-480x360.jpg 480w, https:\/\/www.red-radish.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/radish-operation-840x630.jpg 840w, https:\/\/www.red-radish.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/radish-operation-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.red-radish.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/radish-operation.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>The new look Red Radish operation<\/h2>\n<p>In a very short space of time we practically rebuilt a premises to house an area we could cook, pack and ship these meals, all under strict social distancing and hygiene measures. We can always count on our Radishes to pull together and do the donkey work, but they\u2019ve gone over and above to make this operation tick.<\/p>\n<p>Our chefs have continued to cook delicious food, our packing team have bagged every single meal up, and our drivers have made sure these are all delivered safely and promptly to each hotel. Not to mention the crucial work behind the scenes to make this all logistically possible!<\/p>\n<p>During this project, we\u2019ve run the numbers and have it at <strong>around 175,000 meals that we\u2019ve prepared, packed and delivered<\/strong> to the hotels in the St Mungo\u2019s\/MoL remit and a couple of other local authorities so far.<\/p>\n<p>This situation has hit us extremely hard as a business, and many others, so we\u2019ve been massively grateful and proud to have been put to work on this job.
