It seemed only right that given we would have the infrastructure in place and plenty of hands on deck, we should do our bit to help as many vulnerable folk out as we could.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past five or six weeks, <strong>Red Radish have been donating thousands of delicious hot meals<\/strong> to various charities, community groups, rough-sleepers, families, front-line workers, and volunteers across London, Winchester, Basingstoke and the surrounding villages. A big shout out to the wonderful <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FirstBiteCo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FirstBite<\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mha.org.uk\/live-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MHA Live at Home Scheme<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salvationarmy.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Salvation Army<\/a> for their support on this.<\/p>\n<h2>Setting up a temporary kitchen and food delivery service during coronavirus<\/h2>\n<p>Our temporary kitchen is able to produce delicious food and our drivers are working hard to deliver to locations right across London and surrounding areas.<\/p>\n<p>Using our own cash, a couple of donations, some sporadic free food, plus any small profit made on the St Mungo&#8217;s job; we\u2019ve been able to drop meals on the doorsteps of hospitals, community centres, elderly neighbours and many more.<\/p>\n<p><em>Check out the video of the Radishes in action.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/39OGHJtowII\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>In what has been such a bleak situation for so many, it\u2019s been heart-warming to feel the love and gratitude that something as simple as a hot meal can bring.
