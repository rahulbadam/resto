As it was going to be visited by lots of Brit&#8217;s I thought I should do the kind of food us Brit&#8217;s do occasionally miss.  So as one of the children was coming home from boarding school for Half Term I decided to put in a sausage and bacon order to to be delivered the day of her flying home.  It worked very well and the sausage smuggler arrived home with 150 sausages and a ton of bacon!<\/p>\n<p>Luckily we had our lovely friend Nigel &#8216;wannabe-catwalk-model&#8217; Hindle coming to stay for the weekend who actually thought he was going to sit in the sun and relax but I had other ideas! He made a perfect grill chef and spent the whole weekend making bacon and sausage sandwiches, couldn&#8217;t have done it without him. We also sold a mountain of cupcakes, carrot cakes and chocolate brownies and the steak, caramalised onion and mozzarella hot wraps were a huge hit along with my quiche and salads.  So a very successful fun weekend.<\/p>\n<p>Next secret supper dates are coming soon but we are thinking of the weekend of 18th or 19th June and it&#8217;s going to be on the beach somewhere. Just planning it at the moment and will post the date as soon as we know for definite.<\/p>\n<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/tracker\/6914858505999429751-1329600342353660073?l=redradishsupperclub.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" \/><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to run a little cafe so when asked me to do the catering for the Career and Lifestyle expo I jumped at the chance.
